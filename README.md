# subset_sum_automata

Solved the Subset Sum Automata problem on Reddit r/dailyprogrammer. 

## TODO:

- ~~Add command line flags for the following things:~~
  - ~~Fullscreen~~
  - ~~Set size (w, h) for drawing.~~
  - ~~Set min and max range values.~~
  - ~~Target value / increment / decrement~~

- ~~Clean up check\_neighbors function~~

- ~~Add in a man file.~~(Technically this was done by the clap crate with --help)


All finished here. Works nicely and as intended. If you find any bugs please open an issue.
